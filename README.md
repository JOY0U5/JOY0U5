Hey Friend! I'm Joy Lindstrom 
I enjoy comedy, recreation and video games! I'm learning full stack development and I hope to make fantasic web apps to share my passions. 
-  I am learning...
  -  Javascript (MERN)
  -  Python and Chalice
  -  Vue 
  -  Gremlin 
-  Have any suggestions? I'm not always the quickest learner but I'm persistant and I appreciate any guidance.
